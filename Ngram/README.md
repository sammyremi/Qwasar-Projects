# Welcome to My Ngram
Welcome to My Ngram project in C language.

## Task
The task was created to allow us create a working program to count the number of times a character appears in a string.

## Description
Two functions were created, one to sort the strings being passed as arguments in alphabetical order, the other function carries out the task of combining the multiple strings passed in into one string, searching for duplicate characters and counting how many times each character appears in the strings alphabetically.

## Installation
No installation is required, all that is required is a compilation step using makefile.

## Usage
Once the project is compiled using makefile, the executed file should be called as well as the strings to be worked on, these would be passed into the command line as arguments.

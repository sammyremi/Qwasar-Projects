Welcome to my bouncing box where we get to move our box to bounce

## Description
I was able to get the x and y axis to decrese and increase if greather
than the window width or height

Run command to install nodejs : sudo apt install nodejs.
Run command to verify installation by checking version: node -v or node –version.

npm is the package manager for the Node JavaScript platform. It puts modules in place so that node can find them, and manages dependency conflicts intelligently.
